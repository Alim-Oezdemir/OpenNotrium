-Ville Mönkkönen will retain all rights to the Notrium intellectual property, including name, source code, game content and characters. I'm probably going to release a Notrium 2 at some point, so I still want to own everything related to it.
-Any changes (be it source code or game content) from the original Notrium posted on the Open Notrium version shall be under some nice open source license.
-The Open Notrium shall have a perpetual license to use material and source code from the original 2003 Notrium, and to release new binary versions of the game to the public. Any releases shall be free for the end user.
-The original developers shall be credited in a clearly visible place.

In short, the idea is that people can make changes, and they can release new versions of the Open Notrium for free if they like, but I will be able to make new Notrium versions without releasing my new stuff for free.
